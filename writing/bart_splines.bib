	Abstract = { Bayesian additive regression trees (BART) provides a flexible approach to fitting a variety of regression models while avoiding strong parametric assumptions. The sum-of-trees model is embedded in a Bayesian inferential framework to support uncertainty quantification and provide a principled approach to regularization through prior specification. This article presents the basic approach and discusses further development of the original algorithm that supports a variety of data structures and assumptions. We describe augmentations of the prior specification to accommodate higher dimensional data and smoother functions. Recent theoretical developments provide justifications for the performance observed in simulations and other settings. Use of BART in causal inference provides an additional avenue for extensions and applications. We discuss software options as well as challenges and future directions. },

	Abstract = {Ensemble learning is a statistical paradigm built on the premise that  many weak learners can perform exceptionally well when deployed collectively. The BART method of Chipman et al. (2010) is a prominent example of Bayesian ensemble learning, where each learner is a tree. Due to its impressive performance, BART has received a lot of attention from practitioners. Despite its wide popularity, however, theoretical studies of BART have  begun emerging only very recently. Laying down foundation for the theoretical analysis of Bayesian forests,  Rockova and van der Pas (2017) showed optimal posterior concentration under conditionally uniform tree priors. These priors  deviate from the actual priors implemented in BART. Here, we study the exact BART prior and propose a simple modification so that  it also enjoys optimality properties. To this end, we dive into the branching processes theory. We obtain  tail bounds for the distribution of total progeny under heterogeneous Galton-Watson (GW) processes using their connection to random walks. We conclude with a result stating  optimal rate of convergence for BART.},
